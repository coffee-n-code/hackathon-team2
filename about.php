					<h1>About Us</h1>
					<p>The goal of Good Cop Bad Cop is to bring greater accountability to police forces as well as the communities they serve by fostering
						positive connections and honest communication. We believe in the power of storytelling to reveal the otherwise unseen narratives of interactions between citizens and 
						law enforcement officers. With the actions of police officers, as well as citizens, being so often called into question, our platform seeks to reconcile discrepancies
						between varying stories of similar incidents to support peaceful conflict resolution.</p>
					<p>Good Cop Bad Cop started at a hackathon, an all-night coding event at the Centre for Social Innovation.</p>
